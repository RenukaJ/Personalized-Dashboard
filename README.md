    3.	Open cmd in the project folder location.
    4.	Type command “grails compile” and press enter.
    5.	Wait until the process completes.
    6.	Next, type "grails war CPSC476.war" command and press enter. 
    7.	This will create war file in project's root directory (not in the target or any other folder).

    Run application using created WAR file
    1.	Copy “CPSC476.war” from project’s root directory into the webapps directory of Tomcat.
    2.	Start Tomcat.
    3.	Go to Tomcat Manager at http://localhost:8080/ and click on Manager APP.
    4.	Click on / CPSC476 to access the application.

B.	Through NetBeans IDE – Creating WAR
    Create WAR file
    1.	Open NetBeans IDE.
    2.	Click on file -> Import Project -> From ZIP -> Browse to the directory where you have downloaded the ZIP folder of project -> Import. The project will be imported into the NetBeans workspace.
    3.	Sometimes, imported project is not opened automatically in the NetBeans, for that click on File -> Open Project -> Browse the location where project is imported into NetBeans workspace -> Open Project.
    4.	Right click on the project from NetBeans Project Explorer -> click on Build.
    5.	WAR file is created in the “target/” folder in the project.

    Run application using created WAR file
    1.	Copy “TaskManager.war” from project’s “target/” directory into the webapps directory of Tomcat.
    2.	Start Tomcat.
    3.	Go to Tomcat Manager at http://localhost:8080/ and click on Manager APP.
    4.	Click on /TaskManager to access the application.

C.	Through NetBeans IDE – Run command
    1.	Open NetBeans IDE.
    2.	Click on file -> Import Project -> From ZIP -> Browse to the directory where you have downloaded the ZIP folder of project -> Import. The project will be imported into the NetBeans workspace.
    3.	Sometimes, imported project is not opened automatically in the NetBeans, for that click on File -> Open Project -> Browse the location where project is imported into NetBeans workspace -> Open Project.
    4.	Right click on the project in NetBeans Project Explorer -> Run. Check console to see if the server has started. 
    5.	Access the application at browse location given in the output window http://localhost:8080/TaskManager/
